# Pandio

Simple library for non-blocking I/O operations. Developed mainly for my PandJS project (JavaScript runtime).

### TODO:

- [x] Timers using heap data structure (works like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`).
- [x] Non-blocking IO for sockets using epoll/kqueue/iocp.
- [x] Basic networking abstraction to handle TCP.
- [x] Support Linux.
- [x] Support Windows.
- [x] Thread pool.
- [x] Support BSD/MacOS (tested only on FreeBSD).
- [ ] Signals.
- [ ] Fix tests and GitHub workflows.
- [ ] Async files operations.
- [ ] Better error handling and error reporting to the end-user.
